My Name is Perez Opako and I am a product Designer and this is a little bit of my expertise in my space and positions held 
The Strategic SDLC Orchestrator
6+ Years of Experience Bridging Strategy, Data, and Execution
I am a results-focused professional with over six years of experience successfully guiding complex initiatives through the entire Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC). My unique expertise is defined by my combined roles as a Product/Project Manager, Business Analyst, and Data Analyst, providing me with a holistic view that ensures technical execution is always aligned with strategic business outcomes.
I am fluent in both Agile (Scrum, Kanban) and Waterfall methodologies, giving me the flexibility to structure projects for maximum efficiency, regardless of complexity or scale. I drive projects across all SDLC phases, translating requirements (BA) into successful deliverables (PM) while optimizing real-world operations (Logistics/Sales).
My core value is my ability to use data analysis to inform requirements, measure project success, and continuously improve product strategy. I don't just manage projects; I integrate strategic foresight with rigorous execution, making me an expert at converting business goals into scalable, operational technology solutions.
